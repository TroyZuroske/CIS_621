1. Navigate to project folder so if testing on ix: user@ix-trusty:~ $ cd CIS621_Assignment6/
2. Next run javac -d bin src/trz/uoregon/edu/reliability.java
3. Now navigate to bin directory. cd bin/
4. Finally, Run: java trz.uoregon.edu.reliability <file-path>

Notes: Program finishes running the larger test data sample (inMed.txt) in about
4 minutes. 
For printing out number of copies of each machine for memoized solution I could
not get the program to print the correct numbers (kept printing all zeros) even
though the logic was correct and reliability but I ran out of time to continue 
to debug.   

Thank you.
